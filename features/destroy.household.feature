  Scenario: Delete old household
#     When I am on on the households page
#     Then I should see a list of current locations
#     When I click on the location link 'Smith'
#     Then I should see a button "Destroy this household"
#     When I click the button "Destroy this household"
#     Then I should see a javascript message "Are you sure?"
#     And I click "OK"
#     Then I should see a list of locations without "Smith"
